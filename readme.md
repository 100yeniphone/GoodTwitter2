### Background
Since [GoodTwitter](https://github.com/ZusorCode/GoodTwitter) will [stop working on June 1st 2020](https://twitter.com/ZusorOW/status/1258885451055800320), I decided to create a somewhat fix for the site.

### Disclaimers
- Please keep in mind that a few things break from time to time so creating pull requests and/or issues is appreciated.
- This is by no means a full recreation of the old design, it is more like a hybrid between the two.
- All background themes are fully supported now!
  - The default and dim theme use the color palette from legacy twitter

### Installation
To use this script, you need a userscript manager.

- Simply install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) (others should also work fine I think)
- Then, click on [this link](https://github.com/Bl4Cc4t/GoodTwitter2/raw/master/twitter.gt2eb.user.js) and a new tab should open, prompting you with an installation screen.
- Hit install and youâ€™re good to go!

### Hints
#### The colors do not match my settings!
By default, the blue color and the dim theme are selected and used internally in this script.

To change that, navigate to the display settings and select your current color/background setting again.
Now it should look the way you want!
