### Background
Since [GoodTwitter](https://github.com/ZusorCode/GoodTwitter) will [stop working on June 1st 2020](https://twitter.com/ZusorOW/status/1258885451055800320), I decided to create a somewhat fix for the site.

Please keep in mind that a few things break from time to time so creating pull requests and/or issues is appreciated.



### Installation
To use this script, you need a userscript manager.

- Simply install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) (others should also work fine I think)
- Then, click on [this link](https://github.com/Bl4Cc4t/GoodTwitter2/raw/master/twitter.gt2eb.user.js) and a new tab should open, prompting you with an installation screen.
- Hit install and youâ€™re good to go!
